Welcome to the ONLY Official/Original Supermon Support Group - used with both AllStar-Link and HamVoip Asterisk systems.   No commercial or private sales, ads, or promotions are allowed!

Current version is:  Supermon 7.4+ 
Supermon, The number-1 most capability Web-App you can install and use to completely control both AllStar-Link, And HamVoip Asterisk AllStar images of Ham-Radio VoIP systems.  It is fully scalable and when fully configured can manage small, medium, and extremely large distributed networks of repeaters, etc. systems from a single base Web page.

There are two different versions of Supermon - One version is Only for running on AllStar-Link (ASL1-2) images, [ASL3 ??? no guarantees], the other version is Only for running on HamVoip (HV) image.  BE SURE of which version to install and use based on your AllStar image!  The Wrong version will have many problems.
